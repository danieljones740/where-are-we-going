# where-are-we-going

Created by Dan Jones.  Initial idea by Will Dudley and Dan Jones.

Where Are We Going was created following frustration at finding a pub for three of us to meet; all living in different parts of London and travelling to yet more places for work.  WAWG finds a central location and and suggests places to go.

WAWG is still in its infancy, with plenty issues.  Here are just some of the changes we intend to add at a later stage (and we're open to more suggestions):
 - Changes to calculate a central location based on travel times, not simply averaging the longitude and latitude.  Mathematically, this looks like it'll be a bit more challenging and may require some proper server-side calculations, but it should make this a little more helpful (and stop people from being told to meet in the middle of the Thames)
 - Introducing a proper web framework (Bootstrap?)
 - Remembering locations
 - A configurable radius
 - Proper branding and logos
 - Server-side calculations - doing everything in JavaScript just feels like a bit of a hack
